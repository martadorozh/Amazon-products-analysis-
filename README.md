Amazon Best Sellers prediction

My analysis based on Amazon products by sorting offers according to two lists. One sorted by the latest added products, and the other sorted by popularity and checking which products from the newest list will jump to the most popular products.

Project Plan
1. Build scraper & data collection on the Amazon website.  
2. Product research based on the collected data. 
3. Identification products from the list of the newest which are jumped to the most popular list. 
4. Product analysis based on positive and negative words, and the frequency of occurrence of individual words.
5. Investigate common factors that influence the increase in popularity of a product.
