Amazon Best Sellers prediction & Building a Web Scraper   


This project focuses on identifying the key parameters that contribute to the popularity of new products. By analyzing recent product data, I aim to uncover patterns and characteristics that distinguish successful products from others. The goal is to develop actionable insights and predictive models that can help forecast which of the latest products are most likely to become popular. This analysis will provide valuable guidance for product development, marketing strategies, and decision-making processes.

4. Product analysis based on positive and negative words, and the frequency of occurrence of individual words.
